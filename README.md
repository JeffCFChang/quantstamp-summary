# Co-translate quantstamp whitepaper

There are tons of new different blockchain projects coming out and ICO every day. Lots of them just borrow ideas here and there. I'd like to see some fresh one, and when I meet [Quantstamp](http://quantstamp.com/), I feel it's fresh. 

I love the idea, and totally agree that security is essential. I created a wechat group and shared some basic and summarized information about quantstamp. And some of the members are interested in it too. I mentioned I want to translate the whitepaper and they want to make contribution too. Then I create the project here for easy access.

I am going to thank all contributors for the effort, and I am going to make a list for all of you, demenstrate your contribution, and you make submit the project link as your Proof-of-Care. 

Here are the contributors.
